            It is evident that not all students witin the same school system recieve the same education and are aware <br>
            of the same opportunities To combat the issue we decided to develop a website that provides resources to <br>
            underprivileged students. Our website offers resources for the SAT, and Scholarships. We have even developed <br>
            a game and embedded it into our website to provide a more enjoyable way to learn. When visiting the other pages <br>
            click the headings to go to their website. <br>
